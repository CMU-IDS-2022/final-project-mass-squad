The main goal of this application will be to aid restaurant owners to compare their businesses to other similar businesses and explore avenues of improvement for their own business. Essentially, our application will aid business owners to explore their competitors: either businesses in the same locality, serving similar cuisines, or based on any other relevent attributes. It will enable the users to answer questions such as
 
  - What businesses are most similar to their own business based on various attributes?
  - How the competitors compare to their own business in terms of customer ratings, customer satisfaction, pricing and amenities offered?
  - What attributes of the competitor businesses make them more appealing to customers?
  - What attributes of the user's business are favourable among its customers?
  - What improvements would enable the business owner establish an upper hand over its competitors based on the what favourable attributes are currently missing?
 
The users will be able to interact with various visualizations and filters within the application in order to explore the questions above and gain insight for business strategy enhancement.
